💬 A little bit about me:
Hi I'm Yitzchak Siegel-Bareket, a 32 years old Fullstack Developer from Israel Binyamina. I always had the passion for solving problems, creating and designing. for many years i channeld my passion to the culinary world (as a chef, owner and manager) and to the lituaray field (as a B.A. graduate). Last January i exprinced some coding, and since then i never looked back. I completed a FullStack bootcamp at ITC (Isreal Tech Chalenge) and had an amazing 3-month internship at Cellebrite in which i develped a whole program from scratch all the way to production. I belive that finding success is not a sprint but a marathon, so this is only the begining and i'm super exicted about my future.
